# Methods

## Where the app fits in an RNA-seq workflow

```
FASTQ reads
   │  FastQC         quality check of raw reads
   │  Trimmomatic    trimming of adapters and low-quality bases
   │  HISAT2         alignment to the reference genome (SAM/BAM)
   │  featureCounts  gene-level read counts (Subread)

Count matrix  ──►  THIS APP: QC checks → DESeq2 → annotation → plots and tables
```

Read processing up to the count matrix is done on the command line (Linux). The app starts from the **raw gene count matrix** plus a sample sheet.

## Analysis steps

1. **Reading the data** (`read_file`). Counts and metadata are read from CSV, TSV or TXT. Gene IDs become row names, and counts are stored as integers. Missing values are set to zero if requested; otherwise the app stops. Duplicated sample names stop the analysis, and duplicated gene IDs are removed with a message.
2. **Quality checks** (`qc_check`). The count columns and metadata rows must contain the same samples, in the same order.
3. **Preparing the design** (`prepare_meta`). The grouping columns are converted to factors, and the reference (control) level is set.
4. **Differential expression** (`run_deseq`). A `DESeqDataSet` is built with the design formula. Genes with fewer than 10 counts in total across all samples are removed, then `DESeq()` estimates size factors and dispersions and fits a negative binomial model.
5. **Results** (`extract_results`). `results()` is called for the chosen contrast with the chosen alpha, and normalized counts are extracted. Adjusted p-values use Benjamini–Hochberg.
6. **Annotation** (`annotate_results`). Gene IDs are mapped to gene symbols with `AnnotationDbi::mapIds()` and the selected organism database. If the ID type is not given, it is guessed from the ID format.
7. **Top genes** (`top_genes`). Genes are sorted by adjusted p-value.
8. **Plots.** The volcano plot uses ggplot2 and ggrepel. The heatmap uses ComplexHeatmap on z-scored normalized, VST or rlog values. The bar plot shows log2 fold changes.
